    - title: <u>Hobbies</u>
      items:
        - <b>Books</b> — I have always liked reading adventure, mystery, and thrillers, but I love fantasy (and own all of J. R. R. Tolkien's published works).
        - <b>Cinema</b> — Watching a movie is my favourite everyday pleasure, and I especially like crime dramas and neo-noir.
        - <b>Organizing</b> — I like the feeling after organizing something (cabinets, drawers, wardrobe, folders etc.) and leaving it in order or with some extra free space.
