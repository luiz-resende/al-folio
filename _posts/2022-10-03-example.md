## blog posts

You can just create markdown files and place them inside `_posts/` folder to create posts in the blog section of the page.
It is also possible to create redirect posts by including `redirect: file/page` to the header above, e.g., `redirect: /assets/pdf/example_pdf.pdf`
will redirect to the PDF file.
