# Title

**Direct block simulation of a gold deposit in a Mining Complex in South America**

## Short Description

Use the direct block simulation framework to generate orebody realizations for a complex deposit in a South American mining complex.

## Associated with

Graduate Research Assistant --- McGill University's COSMO Stochastic Mine Planning Laboratory.

## Project Description

For decades, the literature has shown that the uncertainty arising from different sources can be a significant cause of mining project failures, among which the uncertainty in mineral supply is one of the most important.

In transitioning to stochastic optimization models, one must first shift the representation of the mineral deposit from a single estimated orebody model to a set of equiprobable simulations necessary as input for stochastic models.

Different methods were proposed to generate the orebody simulations, among which the Direct Block Simulation (Godoy, 2003; [Boucher & Dimitrakopoulos, 2009](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11004-008-9178-0.pdf)) method helps improve CPU time and manage support-scale effects.

## Status

Completed between November 2019 and December 2019.
