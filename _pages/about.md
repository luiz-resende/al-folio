Hello there, and welcome to my page!

My name is Luiz Resende Silva. I started my academic career as an undergraduate at [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br) in Brazil, where I completed a B.A.Sc. in Mining and Mineral Engineering. In 2018 I went to [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/mining/), where I finished my M.Eng. in Mining Engineering, focusing my studies on stochastic orebody modelling and simultaneous stochastic optimization of mining complexes.

I am comfortable with fast-paced environments and enjoy research and academic fields, which led me to pursue a doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca), where I am currently researching Short-term Optimization of Open Pit Mines. I am also currently registered as a student member in both [GERAD](https://www.gerad.ca/en) and [CIRRELT](https://www.cirrelt.ca/default.aspx).

Here you can find a little more information on the projects I have done and the ones I am currently working on, as well as my publications, _curriculum_, skills and ways to contact me.
